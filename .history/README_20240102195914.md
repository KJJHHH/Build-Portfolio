# Build Stock Portfolio🦁🙉😹🧑💗🦁🏋🐱


Build stock portfolio by utilising different machine learning algorithm including linear regressions, SVM, tree methods, and deep learning and train the algorithms with rolling prediction for each month. The portfolios are based on automotive, semi conductor, and TFT-LCD industry.

## Data and Preprocessing
- The data for training algorithms are downloaded from TEJ database, including fundimental, chip, and [Betas](https://api.tej.com.tw/columndoc.html?subId=51) data. Besides, we compute the technical analysis values include RSI, SMA, EMA, MACD, bband, KD, beta, willr, and bias with [talib packages](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python?tab=readme-ov-file#indicator-groups) 
    - 🗣️ [Tutorial for talib](https://medium.com/ai%E8%82%A1%E4%BB%94/%E7%94%A8-python-%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97-158-%E7%A8%AE%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E6%8C%87%E6%A8%99-26f9579b8f3a)

- The date to update monthly portfolio for each month: The last revenue announce date for all companies. If any announcement date is later than 12th, delete the company for the month

- For each prediction in rolling prediction, use five-year training data to predict the adjacent month




## Algorithm
- Implement different machine learning algorithm and compare the results. The algorithms include:
    - 📝Multiple linear regression
    - 📝Elastic Net
    - 📝Decision tree
    - 📝Random forest
    - 📝Xgboost
    - 📝SVM
    - 📝Neural Network
        - Fully connected deep learning structure
        - Dynamic udpate learning rate: if loss decrease for the epoch comparing to the previous epoch, learning rate *= 1.2; otherwise learning rate *= 0.8 and restore the model from previous epoch
        - Stopping criteria: low enough loss, learning rate too low, and epoch
        - Tuning: layers, activation function, ...

- For each algorithms, we utilise grid search or random search with training data.
