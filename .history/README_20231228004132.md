# Build Stock Portfolio🦁🙉😹🧑💗🦁🏋🐱


🐱 Building stock portfolio utilising different machine learning algorithm including linear regressions, SVM, tree methods, and deep learning.
The portfolios are based on automotive, semi conductor, and TFT-LCD industry.\
Training the algorithms with rolling prediction for each month.

- 🖼️ Sub-Project: [Week Portfolio by Regression Analysis](https://github.com/KJJHHH/Build-Portfolio/tree/master/TEJ_portfolio)

## Data and Preprocessing
🐱 The data for training algorithms are downloaded from TEJ database, including fundimental, chip, and [Betas](https://api.tej.com.tw/columndoc.html?subId=51) data. Besides, we compute the technical analysis values include RSI, SMA, EMA, MACD, bband, KD, beta, willr, and bias with [talib packages](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python?tab=readme-ov-file#indicator-groups) 

🐱 Update date for monthly portfolio: The last revenue announce date for all companies. If any announcement date is later than 12th, delete the company for the month

🐱 For each prediction in rolling prediction, use five-year training data to predict the adjacent month

## Algorithm
🐱 Implement different machine learning algorithm and compare the results. The algorithms include:
- 📝Multiple linear regression
- 📝Elastic Net
- 📝Decision tree
- 📝Random forest
- 📝Xgboost
- 📝SVM
- 📝Neural Network
    - Fully connected deep learning structure
    - Dynamic udpate learning rate: if loss decrease for the epoch comparing to the previous epoch, learning rate *= 1.2; otherwise learning rate *= 0.8 and restore the model from previous epoch
    - Stopping criteria: low enough loss, learning rate too low, and epoch
    - Tuning: layers, activation function, ...

🐱 For each algorithms, we utilise grid search or random search with training data.
