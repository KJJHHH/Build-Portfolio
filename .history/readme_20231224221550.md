# Build Stock Portfolio
### Sub-Project: [Regression Analysis](https://github.com/KJJHHH/Build-Portfolio/tree/master/TEJ_portfolio)

🐱 Building stock portfolio utilising different machine learning algorithm including linear regressions, SVM, tree methods, and deep learning.
The portfolios are based on automotive, semi conductor, and TFT-LCD industry.\

🐱 Training the algorithms with rolling prediction for each month.

## 🦁 Data and Preprocessing
😹 The data for training algorithms are downloaded from TEJ database, including fundimental, chip, and [Betas](https://api.tej.com.tw/columndoc.html?subId=51) data. Besides, we compute the technical analysis values include RSI, SMA, EMA, MACD, bband, KD, beta, willr, and bias with [talib packages](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python?tab=readme-ov-file#indicator-groups) 
- 📝 [Tutorial for talib](https://medium.com/ai%E8%82%A1%E4%BB%94/%E7%94%A8-python-%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97-158-%E7%A8%AE%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E6%8C%87%E6%A8%99-26f9579b8f3a)

🖼️ Update date for monthly portfolio: The last revenue announce date for all companies. If any announcement date is later than 12th, delete the company for the month
🗣️ For each prediction in rolling prediction, use five-year training data to predict the adjacent month

## 🦁 Algorithm
😹 Implement different machine learning algorithm and compare the results. The algorithms include:
- Multiple linear regression
- Elastic Net
- Decision tree
- Random forest
- Xgboost
- SVM
- Neural Network
    - 📝 Structure
    - Fully connected deep learning structure
    - Dynamic udpate learning rate: if loss decrease for the epoch comparing to the previous epoch, learning rate *= 1.2; otherwise learning rate *= 0.8 and restore the model from previous epoch
    - Stopping criteria: low enough loss, learning rate too low, and epoch
    - The 

😹 For each algorithms, we utilise grid search or random search with training data.
- [Machine learning tuning with sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html)
- [Deep learning tuning with optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna)

### 🦁 Result
