## Model Diagnosis and variable selectio
Take first rolling period data to check assumptions of multiple linaer regression. We can see that the data is neither normal nor idenetical (for residuals), hence methods coping with violation of the assumptions are adopted to solve the problem.

- **1. Preprocess of data**
    - Standardise
    - Winsorise
    
- **2. Linearity**
    - Polynomial
    - *Kernel Method (skip)*
    - *Spline (skip)*
        - [Splines Elaboration](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34825299)
        - [Cubic-Splines Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tgteacher/numerical-methods/blob/master/notebooks/Chapter3.ipynb#scrollTo=SLLvPEzPnYCr): poly interpolation, cubic interpolation, and Newton interpolation
    - After implementing Polynomial methods, select variables by correlation for each variables to avoid the noise brougt by lots of data.

- **3. Independent of epsilons (residuals)**
    - Since the sample is large, do not have to deal with it.

- **4. Collinearity**
    - From the notes showed when fitting models, we can see that collinearity exist in variables. Use PCA to reduce correlation between each variables.
    - Note from regression
        - [1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
        - [2] The condition number is large, 1.6e+16. This might indicate that there are strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems

- **5. Forward selecting variables by BIC (Skip)**
    - To reduce the variance of covariate slope (coefficient)

- **6. Normality and Homogeneity**
    - [HCCM](https://jslsoc.sitehost.iu.edu/files_research/testing_tests/hccm/00TAS.pdf): cope with not identicle residuals
        - HAC (Covarinace type)
        - use HC0 in HCCM, heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix, where HC1, HC2, and HC3 are adjustment under small sample.
    - Weighted least square: cope with not identicle residuals
        - [**NYCU L17 weighted least square 1:16:00**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAREvGsRjdo&list=PLj6E8qlqmkFu0cY9PfwoFq6SbuZ-M28JE&index=17)
            - Fail when computing weight, don't know why
        - ***ref*** [WLS python](https://www.einblick.ai/python-code-examples/weighted-least-squares-regression-statsmodels/) - cope with what???
            - <font color=#FF00FF> check weight correctness. The version now is not same as in NYCU class</font>:

## Improvement and Discussion
- Factor research
    - Add more factors
    - Fit model sort by industry
